                    <p>Southeast Idaho is a paradise for fishing.  If you stay on the Interstate highways you'll see very
                         little of the abundance of waters which make the area a Mecca for dedicated fishermen winter and summer.<br>
                    <br>
                    Thirty one fishable reservoirs and many streams, creeks, and rivers are located in the 110 mile length 
                        and 105 mile breadth of this travel region. Species include Rainbow Trout, Cutthroat Trout, Brown Trout, 
                        Brook Trout, Lake Trout, Bull Trout, Chinook, Salmon, Kokanee Salmon, Coho Salmon, Steelhead, White Sturgeon,
                         Mountain Whitefish, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Crappie, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Channel Catfish, Bullhead Catfish,

                    Seasons and catch limits vary widely in the region and licenses are required.  Short term and season non resident fishing
                         and hunting licenses and official information publications are available at sporting goods shops in each community.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Idaho Fish & Game Fishing Trailer travels all over southeast Idaho each summer!  It is equipped with fishing gear for 
                    use by the public for free, they provide fishing instruction to those that need it, and if you register 
                    at the trailer— no fishing license is necessary! (https://idahohighcountry.org/)</p>
