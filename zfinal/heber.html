                        DISCOVERY<br><br>
                        The Heber Valley / Wasatch County area was originally discovered by Native Americans; the Timpanogos Utes being the most
                         recent. The area was used primarily as a summer hunting ground and as an area where materials for hunting tools could be
                          found and produced. "Wasatch" in the Uto-Aztecan language means "mountain pass" or "low pass over high range."
                        <br><br>
                        PARADISE LAND<br><br>
                        On a summer morning in 1857 workers employed at a sawmill in Big Cottonwood Canyon hiked to the summit of the Wasatch 
                        Range and viewed a high mountain valley to the southeast that had been reputed as a "paradise land." Hearing promising 
                        reports from the sawmill workers and others, a group of cattlemen left Provo in the Spring of 1858 and drove their herds 
                        up Provo Canyon to establish ranches in the south end of the valley while others during the spring and summer of 1858 
                        explored the area with an eye toward future settlement.
                        <br><br>
                        FROM LONDON TO HEBER CITY<br><br>
                        A pioneer party consisting primarily of LDS converts from Great Britain arrived on May 2, 1859. They camped about one
                         mile north of present Heber City and christened the townsite "London." The London townsite was surveyed in June 1859
                          by the Utah County Deputy Surveyor, Jesse Fuller. The initial point of Fuller's survey was established at what is now
                           the north of end of Heber City Main Street. In 1862 Wasatch County was created by the territorial legislature and at
                            that time the London townsite was renamed Heber City in recognition of the love the LDS settlers from Britain had for
                             their Mission Leader, Heber C. Kimball. As the largest settlement in the area, Heber City was established as the 
                             county seat.
